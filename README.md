<br>

## Description

* Now that we have provided this important information, let's start talking a little about what we will do during this course, from the product we will develop to the technical part of the resources and technologies we will use.

* To do this, I will present the IDE that we will use during the course, which is Android Studio. It will show the application we are going to develop: Orgs. The idea of the application is to simulate a virtual store of natural products.

* On the first screen, a purple header with "Orgs" written in the left corner, and a button with a "+" in the bottom right corner. On this screen we will have a list of products, which is currently empty, because we don't have any products yet.

* If we want to create a product, we interact with the button in the lower right corner, known as the Floating Action Button. Clicking on it, the screen changes to a form with the fields "Name", "Description" and "Value". At the bottom of the screen, we also have the "Save" button. We will learn how to add this action to a form, which will allow us to create a product. For example, we want to create a fruit basket, so we will fill in the form:
```
Name:
Fruit basket

Description:
Orange, mango and strawberry

Value:
12.9

```
